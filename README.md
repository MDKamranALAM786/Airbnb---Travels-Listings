## 🛡️ Security Warning Clarification

If your browser shows a security warning like “Dangerous Site,” please be assured that:

- This project is **purely educational** and created as part of a MERN stack learning journey.
- It **does not contain any harmful scripts or malware**.
- All features (like authentication, maps, and file uploads) are implemented securely using well-known services like **Cloudinary, Mapbox, and Passport.js**.
- The backend is built using **secure REST APIs** that follow best practices.
- The warning may be triggered because the domain is hosted on **Render**, which uses shared infrastructure — occasionally flagged unfairly by Google Safe Browsing.

You are **safe to use this website** for demonstration purposes.  
To explore its features, you can sign up using any **fake or sample credentials** and add **dummy data** — no real personal or sensitive information is required.
